# hello-world-again
second time following instructions to learn about github

this is me trying the branch function. I'm editing the readme file.  
I creat a new branch which look exactly the same with main branch.  
I can edit the new branch without causing any chaos to the main branch.  
I can add lines and see how they work.  
I can merge the new commitments to the main branch if the 结果 meets my needs.  
This is my understanding about branching.  
  
I add some markdown syntax to the lines above. Let's see how it works.

It worked well! Cool! Also,I'm adding some emoji to this text. Github FAQ says If you want to add any emoji , just type ":" . A list of suggested emojis will show up! But as i type ":", none of them showed up. That's weird. maybe i should remember the codes myself. For example,":+1" = 👍  add an emoji by typing its emojicode between two 冒号s ":emojicode:"
please check this page for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
I'm merging this branch to the main branch. Good luck! 👍 👍 👍

markdown语法还挺难用的，换行需要末尾两空格再加回车，或者用“<br>”,我哪会html的语言啊hai！迟早要学的。暂时就这么多。我merge这个branch到main先。
