# hello-world-again
second time following instructions to learn about github

this is me trying the branch function. I'm editing the readme file.  
I creat a new branch which look exactly the same with main branch.  
I can edit the new branch without causing any chaos to the main branch.  
I can add lines and see how they work.  
I can merge the new commitments to the main branch if the 结果 meets my needs.  
This is my understanding about branching.  
  
I add some markdown syntax to the lines above. Let's see how it works.

It worked well! Cool! Also,I'm adding some emoji to this text. ":emojicode:",用这个方法可以添加emoji，在两个冒号内输入对应的emojicode就可以了，例如 : +1 : 是点赞的emoji :+1:。
please check this page for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
I'm merging this branch to the main branch. Good luck! 👍 👍 👍

markdown语法还挺难用的，换行需要末尾两空格再加回车，或者用“< br >”,我哪会html的语言啊hai！迟早要学的。暂时就这么多。我merge这个branch到main先。
