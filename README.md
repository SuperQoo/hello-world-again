# hello-world-again
second time following instructions to learn about github

this is me trying the branch function. I'm editing the readme file.  
I creat a new branch which look exactly the same with main branch.  
I can edit the new branch without causing any chaos to the main branch.  
I can add lines and see how they work.  
I can merge the new commitments to the main branch if the 结果 meets my needs.  
This is my understanding about branching.  
  
I add some markdown grammar to the lines above. Let's see how it works.
